# Fiftyville Theft - Criminal Investigation with SQL

## Overview

This project was completed as part of Harvard University's CS50x. I used SQL queries to investigate a database `log.sql`, piecing together information to solve a crime.
These queries can reveal information which may be spoilers to students currently in the course. Please honor all academic honesty policies!
